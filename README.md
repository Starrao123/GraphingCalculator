# GraphingCalculator
In this project I built a graphing calculator that receives as input a string that expresses a univariate mathematical function (in x) and produces a corresponding 2-d graph. The calculator can perform symbolic differentiation to find the derivative of the function and plot it as well. To this end, the program parses a string from the user into a tree representation, and then evaluates the tree after substituting specific values for the dependent variable x.

Through this project, I learned how to use context-free grammar and parse tree to build a recursive descent parser. I also strengthened my understanding of object-oriented design concepts.
